I mean, it's his dream. He built the dream... The question is, what are his incentives? ...I think it ties them together.\"  @andrewrsorkin: \"This is the ultimate skin in the game... I would argue it's about as shareholder-friendly as you'd get.\"   @jimcramer: \"I didn't like it. I loved it. Because you know what? I would double what he gets if he makes that much money for people. And I wish that everyone would take that. I know there was a discussion. I thought that was a great piece. Holy cow. Because what it really did present you was here's a man of conviction.\"  @andrewrsorkin: \"I asked him what do you need this money for? Because he always says he's not incentivized by money. And his answer was, he said, 'Look, I want to help humanity pursue this multi-planetary system. Meaning he wants us all to live on Mars. And he said that requires a certain amount of capital. And for his sake, if it works, it may go towards that, which may go towards all of us.\"  @elonmusk\n",

I would argue it's about as shareholder-friendly as you'd get.\"   @jimcramer: \"I didn't like it. I loved it. Because you know what? I would double what he gets if he makes that much money for people. And I wish that everyone would take that. I know there was a discussion. I thought that was a great piece. Holy cow. Because what it really did present you was here's a man of conviction.\"  @andrewrsorkin: \"I asked him what do you need this money for? Because he always says he's not incentivized by money. And his answer was, he said, 'Look, I want to help humanity pursue this multi-planetary system. Meaning he wants us all to live on Mars. And he said that requires a certain amount of capital.
